    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system, while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">There are many classifications of education. One of them depends on the institutional framework and distinguishes between formal, non-formal, and informal education. Another classification includes different levels of education based on factors like the student's age and the complexity of the content. Further categories focus on the topic, the teaching method, the medium used, and the funding.[27]

    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Lecture Notes fo Data Structures and AlgorithBubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite hig
Bubble Sort AlgorithmIn Bubble Sort algorithm, traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

How does Bubble Sort Work?
Let us understand the working of bubble sort with the help of the following illustration:

Input: arr[] = {6, 3, 0, 5}


First Pass: 

The largest element is placed in its correct position, i.e., the end of the array.

Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the largest element at correct position
Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the largest element at correct position

Second Pass: 

Place the second largest element at correct position

Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the second largest element at correct position
Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the second largest element at correct position

Third Pass:

Place the remaining two elements at their correct positions.

Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the remaining elements at their correct positions
Bubble Sort Algorithm : Placing the remaining elements at their correct positions

Total no. of passes: n-1
Total no. of comparisons: n*(n-1)/2
Implementation of Bubble Sort
Below is the implementation of the bubble sort. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap. 


// Optimized implementation of Bubble sort
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 
void swap(int* xp, int* yp)
{
    int temp = *xp;
    *xp = *yp;
    *yp = temp;
}
 
// An optimized version of Bubble Sort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
    int i, j;
    bool swapped;
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        swapped = false;
        for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                swap(&arr[j], &arr[j + 1]);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
 
        // If no two elements were swapped by inner loop,
        // then break
        if (swapped == false)
            break;
    }
}
 
// Function to print an array
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
}
 
// Driver program to test above functions
int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90 };
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    bubbleSort(arr, n);
    printf("Sorted array: \n");
    printArray(arr, n);
    return 0;}
